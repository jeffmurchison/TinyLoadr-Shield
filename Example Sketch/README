TinyLoadr Blink Example Sketch by Jeff Murchison (jeff@jeffmurchison.com)


To install, copy the TinyLoadr_Shield folder to your Arduino’s libraries folder.

This is located in the Arduino sketchbook. If you don’t know where this is, check your settings / preferences in the Arduino application.

For example, in OS X, the default location is:

~/Documents/Arduino/

So you would copy the TinyLoadr_Shield folder to:

~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/

After copying it, restart the Arduino application and you should now see a TinyLoadr_Shield option under File > Examples.
